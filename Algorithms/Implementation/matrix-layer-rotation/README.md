# Build

* Make sure to include your own version of `libstdc++-6.dll`, I've included mine from GCC 6.3.0.
* Configure the scons makefile (`SConstruct`) if necessary.
* Run the following commands:

    `scons`  
    `main.exe`  

# Testing custom input

1. `main < input06.txt >> out.txt`
2. Diff against output06.txt, should be identical.
